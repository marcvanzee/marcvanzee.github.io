## About me

Senior researcher/engineer at Google Brain, Denmark. Previously at Google Brain Amsterdam, and Google Brain Zurich. I am a co-lead of the [Flax team](https://flax.readthedocs.io). My research interests lie at the intersection of knowledge representation/reasoning and deep learning. I have a PhD from University of Luxembourg, did a PhD internship at Google Pittsburgh and a PhD exchange to Stanford University.

## Projects

**Flax, Google Brain, Copenhagen/Amsterdam (2020-now)** \
Role: Lead (2022-now); Team member (2020-2022) \
Technology: Python, C++, DL, LLMs

[Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io) is a neural network library built on top of [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io). We provide abstractions for training machine learning models. Flax is used  both in the open source community (like [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/flax-community)) and internally Google (like [PaLM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html), [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google), [Scenic](https://github.com/google-research/scenic/), [Big Vision](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision), and [T5X](https://github.com/google-research/t5x)). \
Flax started in early 2020, and I joined a few months after. We grew from 4 to 10 member and now support most of Google Research. I helped many users and led a number of projects such as [JAX on the web](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/08/jax-on-web-with-tensorflowjs.html), and a [HuggingFace hackathon](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/open-to-the-community-community-week-using-jax-flax-for-nlp-cv/7104) (over 800 participants). We won the Google Tech Impact award in 2021, and I received over 15 peer bonuses and 5 spot bonuses for my impact in the project.

**T5X, Google Brain, Amsterdam (2020-2022)** \
Role: Technical contributor \
Technology: Python, LLMs, DL

[T5X](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) is a modular, composable, research-friendly framework for high-performance sequence models at many scales. \
I was one of the main technical contributors to T5X, and I was responsible for improving the JAX model parallelism logic, running experiments and overall code improvements. To learn more, see the [T5X Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17189).

**Elysium, Google Brain, Zurich (2017-2022)** \
Role: Engineer/Researcher \
Technology: Javascript, C++, NLP, DL

Elysium consisted of a team of 13 members trying to rebuild the Google Assistant from the ground up using ideas from description logic. We built and end-to-end prototype for a chatbot and published two papers ([1](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SygcCnNKwr), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08970)). \
Initially, I was responsible for various aspects of the protoype (e.g.: front-end logic, coreference resolution, a context abstraction), but once we started using more Deep Learning, I led setting up the infrastructure based on [T5](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html) and doing all relevant experiments for both publications.
